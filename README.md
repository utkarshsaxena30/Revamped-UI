# ðŸ’„Revamped-UI

Revamped UI is my attempt to create UI focused apps to display my front-end skills, with little to no focus on the backend. I'll develop multiple run of the mill or
out of the box projects in this repository. They may or may not be impressive in functionality, but they will be pretty aesthetic.

I use Sass as a preprocessor to my CSS, so if you want to run any of the projects on your local machine, either make changes directly in the compiled CSS (but it will make
things messy) or use `sass --watch sassfolder:cssfolder` where sassfolder and cssfolder are aliases to the Sass and CSS directories.

Below are the projects currently in the repository. This is an ongoing process, so I'll be committing new projects regularly.

## âœ¨Todo List
A simple todo list with an option to swtich between light and dark themes. The design is responsive and the list items are draggable. I used react-beautiful-dnd for that, 
so you can check it out if interested. I'll add the link to the deployed site soon.
